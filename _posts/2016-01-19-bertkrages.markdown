The client wanted a clean, simple, yet modern look for his law practice.

He was familiar with basic web programming and had created his previous website on his own, so he desired the technologies used to be consistent with what he had. For this reason, I built this from the ground up using only html and css.

<a href="http://www.krages.com"><img src="http://jenleebell.com/img/krages.jpg" alt="Krages dot com"/></a>

He is also a photographer, so his photographs throughout his site to showcase his work.
